# bootc-integration-test-action

This action runs integration tests against any bootable container image.

## How it works

1. The image to be tested and the tests to be run are passed in via the action inputs.
2. [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) is used to add a thin layer onto the image to ensure ssh, networking, and container policies are configured to allow testing to function. This test image is pushed to the registry using an `integrationtest-UUID` tag.
3. [bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder) is used to generate a qcow image with preconfigured ssh.
4. The resulting qcow image is imported into [virt-install](https://linux.die.net/man/1/virt-install).
5. Once the machine has booted, tests are executed on the VM and their output is recorded.
6. As a cleanup step, the test image is removed from the registry.
7. Test output logs are uploaded to Github Artifacts and the action passes if all tests exited with exit code 0.
